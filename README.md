# Shell-Scripting
Shell scripting involves writing a series of commands for the command-line interpreter (shell) to execute. It's a powerful way to automate tasks, streamline repetitive processes, and interact with the operating system and its components.
Automation: Simplifies repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort and potential errors.

Customization: Allows tailoring scripts to specific needs or environments.

Integration: Easily integrates with other tools and systems.

Rapid Prototyping: Quickly test ideas or configurations in a controlled environment.
